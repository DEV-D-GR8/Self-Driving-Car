# Self-Driving-Car
As the name suggests, this project trains and implements an AI model that can drive the car on a track without collission.
Firstly, the model is trained using NEAT-python. After the training, the model can drive the car by itself.

# Tech Stack
1. Python
2. Pygame
3. NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augumenting Topologies)

# Inspiration
The project is inspired from Code Bullet's Youtube video on car simulation. He used Q-learning to train the AI.
I made use of NEAT to train the AI model.

# Challenges
The first challenge was making the car move on a still background. The rotational dynamics of the car were difficult to implement.
The second challenege was implementing a good fitness function. It took the most time and required a lot of research and trials.

# Future
I will work on a manual mode where the user can race against the AI.
